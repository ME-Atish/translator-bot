# Telegram Translation Bot

ðŸ¤– A Telegram bot that translates text into Persian (Farsi). Built with Node.js and TypeScript.

---

## Features

- **Text Translation**: Translates any text sent by the user into Persian (Farsi).
- **Easy to Use**: Simply send a message to the bot, and it will reply with the translated text.
- **Lightweight**: Built with Node.js and TypeScript for efficiency and scalability.

## How It Works

1. The user sends a message to the bot.
